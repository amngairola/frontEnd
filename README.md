# frontEnd
Series of React Front-End Daily mini task 

#To run a React project that has been pulled from Git on your local host, you will need to follow these steps:

Ensure that you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download them from the official website https://nodejs.org/en/.

Open your terminal/command prompt and navigate to the root folder of the project.

Run the command npm install to install all the required dependencies mentioned in the package.json file.

After the installation is complete, run the command npm start to start the development server. This will open the project in your default browser at http://localhost:3000/.

If the project has environment variables, create a .env file in the root folder of the project, and add the required variables in the following format: VARIABLE_NAME=value. Make sure to replace VARIABLE_NAME and value with the actual names and values.

If the project uses an API, make sure to provide the API endpoint in the .env file.

You can now make changes to the code, and the browser will automatically reload to reflect the changes.
